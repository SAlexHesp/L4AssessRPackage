Title: State space biomass dynamics model incorporating environmental effects

Description: This is a state space biomass dynamics model with options to incorporate environmental effects
    by fitting to an environmental index. It can also allow for depensatory stock-recruitment dynamics. The model
    is currently in development, with future modifications to link catchability to an envionmental index. The model 
    also calculates maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and biomass at MSY (BMSY) for different environmental conditions.
