<h2>Introduction to L4Assess</h2>
<p>This R package is intended to provide a toolbox of stock assessment
methods associated with use of state space biomass dynamics models for
fish and invertebrate populations. This ‘class’ of stock assessment
models is used widely by the researchers at the Department of Primary
Industries and Regional Development (DPIRD) in Western Australia for
conducting “level 2” or “level 4” assessments. These methods are
typically applied to an annual time series for total catch removals
together with one or more annual time series of fishery independent or
fishery depended catch per unit effort (CPUE), considered to constitute
a reliable index(ces) or population abundance. Multiple biomass dynamics
models have been developed as part of this package, allowing for
incorporation of environmental effects on population abundance and/or
catchability, as well as allowing for the possibility of depensatory
population dynamics. To our knowledge, no other packages have yet been
developed focusing on incorporation of environmental effects on
population dynamics.</p>
<p>This R package essentially provides ‘wrapper’ code to run and produce
diagnostic ouputs for the above ‘state space’ biomass dynamics models,
which have been implemented in template model builder (TMB) (Kristensen
et al., 2015). The models associated with this R package build on the
initial models developed for the study by Marks et al. (2001), exploring
environmental effects (primary productivity) on blue swimmer crabs
(Portunus armatus) in Cockburn Sound Western Australia. This model has
since been extended in various ways to account for environmental impacts
on population dynamics and catchability, including rainfall on banana
prawns in northern Australia (Marks et al., in prep.). The models have
also been used for data limited assessments for sea cucumber stocks in
northern Australia, with extensions to fit models with minimal catch per
unit effort data, by specifying (rather than estimating) a probability
distribution for intrinsic increase (r) and/or also fitting the model to
one or more annual survey estimates of biomass (DPIRD, unpublished).
Please note that the package is still in development and therefore,
changes are expected. As this software is still in development, it is
recommended that for ‘standard assessment’ reporting, i.e. when
environmental variables are not being considered for modelling, it be
used alongside other widely-available and accepted software packages for
state space biomass dynamics modelling, such as ‘Just Another Bayesian
Biomass Assessment’ (JABBA) (Winker et al., 2018), or ‘Surplus
Production model in Continuous-Time’ (SPiCT) (Pederseen and Berg,
2018).</p>

<div id="overview-of-state-space-biomass-dynamics-models" class="section level3">
<h3>Overview of state space biomass dynamics models</h3>
<p>Surplus production models (i.e., biomass dynamics models) represent
stock dynamics in terms of changing levels of annual biomass <span class="math inline">\((B_t)\)</span>, the intrinsic rate of growth <span class="math inline">\((r)\)</span>, the carrying capacity of a
population <span class="math inline">\((K)\)</span>, and annual removals
by fishers <span class="math inline">\((C_t)\)</span>. Biomass dynamics
models, with a discrete difference equation and an annual timestep, were
implemented using a state-space framework to account for both
observation and process errors (e.g., Best and Punt, 2020; Punt, 2003;
Zhou et al., 2009; Marks et al., 2021).</p>
<p>The equation for the state-space biomass dynamics model is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[B_{(t+1)}= (B_t  +
P_t-\hat{C}_t)e^{ξ_t}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(B_{(t+1)}\)</span> is the estimated
biomass at the start of year <span class="math inline">\(t+1\)</span>,
<span class="math inline">\(B_t\)</span> is the biomass at the start of
year <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(P_t\)</span> is the biomass production in year
<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(C{_t}\)</span> is the predicted total catch in
year <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(ξ_t\)</span> is the extent of process error in
year <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(ξ_t ~ N(0;σ_R^2 )\)</span>, estimated as a random
effect (Punt, 2003; Thorson et al., 2012; Marks et al., 2021). The
predicted catch, <span class="math inline">\(C_t\)</span>, is estimated
from the annual harvest rate (i.e., exploitation rate), <span class="math inline">\(H_t\)</span>, and biomass, <span class="math inline">\(B_t\)</span>, such that</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\hat{C}_t= H_tB_t\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(H_t=1⁄(1+e^{-F_t})\)</span>, and
<span class="math inline">\(F_t\)</span> is a logistic-transformed
parameter value for annual exploitation in year <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, estimated as a fixed parameter. While
the unconstrained parameter estimate, <span class="math inline">\(F_t\)</span> lies in the range from <span class="math inline">\(-\infty\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(+\infty\)</span>, the range for <span class="math inline">\(H_t\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(0 &lt;
H_t &lt; 1\)</span>.</p>

<div id="alternative-biomass-dynamics-model-production-equations" class="section level3">
<h3>Alternative biomass dynamics model production equations</h3>
<p>According to the Schaefer production equation, annual production
<span class="math inline">\(P_t\)</span> is calculated as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P_t=
rB_t\bigg(1-\frac{B_t}{K}\bigg)\]</span></p>
<p>Using the Fox production equation, <span class="math inline">\(P_t\)</span> is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P_t=\log_e(K)rB_t\bigg(1-\frac{\log_eB_t}{\log_eK}\bigg)\]</span></p>
<p>Applying the Pella-Tomlinson production equation, <span class="math inline">\(P_t\)</span> is</p>

<h3>Effect of an environmental variable on production</h3>
<p>The influence of an environmental variable on population biomass,
<span class="math inline">\(γ_{(1,t)}\)</span>, is described as a
multiplicative effect (e.g., Mueter and Megrey, 2006; Marks et al.,
2021) using</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[γ_{(1,t)}=e^{(δ_1 X_t)}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(X_t\)</span> is the standardised
rainfall index (mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1) and <span class="math inline">\(δ_1\)</span> is a parameter employed to scale the
influence of envrionment on biomass. The full biomass equation is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[B_{(t+1)}= (B_t  +

<div id="effect-of-depensatory-stock-dynamics-on-production" class="section level3">
<h3>Effect of depensatory stock dynamics on production</h3>
<p>Effects of depensation on production in year <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, denoted <span class="math inline">\(D_t\)</span>, are modelled as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[D_t =
1-\exp\bigg(\frac{\log_e(0.5)B_t}{dK}\bigg)\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is a model parameter describing the
level of depensation, for which a value of approximately 0 indicates no
depensatory effect and 1 indicates full depensation (Hilborn et al.,
2014). For biomass dynamics models employing this depensatory function,
the values of <span class="math inline">\(D_t\)</span> are multiplied by
the annual estimates of surplus production (Hilborn et al., 2014),
i.e.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[B_{t+1} = (B_t +

<p><span class="math display">\[\hat{I_t}=qγ_{(2,t)}B_t\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is the catchability

on catchability in year <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>,
estimated as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[γ_{(2,t)}=e^{(δ_2X_t)}\]</span></p>
</div>
<div id="model-fitting" class="section level3">
<h3>Model fitting</h3>
<p>For models not considering environmental effects on catchability, the
predicted annual CPUE in year <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>,
<span class="math inline">\(\hat{I}_t\)</span>, for each of the catch
rate time series, is calculated as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\hat{I_t}=qB_t\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is the catchability
coefficient for a given CPUE series, estimated as model parameters
(i.e. <span class="math inline">\(q_1\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(q_2\)</span> etc.), and <span class="math inline">\(B_t\)</span> is the annual biomass estimated at
the start of the fishing season. The biomass dynamics models are fitted
using Template Model Builder (TMB) (Kristensen et al., 2015) with the
nlminb optimiser in R (R Core Team, 2019) by minimising the sum of the
negative log-likelihoods associated with the two CPUE series (<span class="math inline">\(λ_m\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(λ_d\)</span>) catch series, and process error
random effects. The negative log-likelihood for each CPUE time series
was calculated as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[λ=∑_t\bigg[0.5\log_e{\big(σ{M_t^2+σ_P^2\big)}}+0.5\log_e
(2π)+\frac{\big(\log_e(I_t

<p>where <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> corresponds to the years
of available CPUE data for each CPUE time series, <span class="math inline">\(I_t\)</span> is the (or one of several) observed,
CPUE time series, <span class="math inline">\(I_t\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(\hat{I_t}\)</span> denotes the estimated annual
CPUE time series, as described above, and <span class="math inline">\(σ_{M_t}^{2}\)</span> is the variance associated
with <span class="math inline">\(I_t\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(σ_P^2\)</span> is an additional, unmeasured
variance associated with input data, specified as a percentage of the
average observed variance associated with <span class="math inline">\(I_t\)</span> across all years (Marks et al.,
2021).</p>
<p>The negative log-likelihood, <span class="math inline">\(λ_c\)</span>, for annual catches is calculated
as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[λ_c=∑_t\bigg[0.5\log_e

\big)^2}{2σ_c^2}\bigg]\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(σ_c^2\)</span> is the variance
associated with the annual catch estimates.</p>
<p>The negative log-likelihood for the random effects, <span class="math inline">\(λ_ξ\)</span>, is calculated as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[λ_ξ=∑_t\bigg[0.5\log_e(σ_R^2+τ^2σ_{t,env}^2)+0.5\log_e(2π)+\frac{ξ_t^2}{2(σ_R^2+τ^2σ_{t,env}^2)}\bigg]\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(σ_R\)</span> is the process error,
<span class="math inline">\(τ\)</span> is a specified additional
variance that modifies the extent to which rainfall is linked to
population dynamics, and <span class="math inline">\(σ_{t,env}\)</span>
are the standard errors associated with the observed annual
environmental deviations relative to the mean environmental index

<div id="methods-for-estimating-msy-and-bmsy" class="section level2">
<h2>Methods for estimating MSY and BMSY</h2>
<p>The package contains functions for producing estimates of maximum
sustainable yield <span class="math inline">\((MSY)\)</span> and the
associated stock biomass <span class="math inline">\((B_{MSY})\)</span>
and, where applicable, after accounting for the influence of the
environmental parameter <span class="math inline">\(δ\)</span>, and/or
depensation parameter <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> (see also
supplementary material for Marks et al. (2021). Documentation is
provided below for estimates from the Schaefer and Fox models.</p>
<p>Broadly, the value of <span class="math inline">\(MSY\)</span> for a
biomass dynamics model with a given form of production function may be
determined by calculating the biomass at which maximum production occurs
and then substituting that value into the relevant production function.
Analytic solutions exist for calculated <span class="math inline">\(B_MSY\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(MSY\)</span> when using the traditional Schaefer,
Fox and Pella-Tomlinnson production functions. For the Schaefer
function, <span class="math inline">\((B_{MSY})\)</span> is calculated
as <span class="math inline">\(BMSY=K/2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(MSY\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(MSY=rK/4\)</span>. For the Fox model, the analytic
solution for <span class="math inline">\(MSY\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(MSY=rK/e\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B_{MSY}=K/e\)</span>.</p>

<h3>Estimating MSY and BMSY using Schaefer and Fox models with
environment linked to production</h3>
<p>For the Schaefer model with the addition of environment (without

specified constant level for the environmental index is <span class="math display">\[MSY=rK\exp(\delta{X_t})/4\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(X_t\)</span> is the environmental deviations
relative to the observed mean, and <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> is a parameter used to describe
the influence of the environment (Mueter and Megrey, 2006). For the Fox
model with the addition of environment (without depensation)</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[MSY=rK\exp(\delta{X_{t−1}})\]</span>.</p>

<h3>Estimating MSY and BMSY using Schaefer and Fox models with

<p>Where a closed-form solution for the biomass associated with maximum

For calculing <span class="math inline">\(B_{MSY}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(MSY\)</span> for models involving depensation (for
which closed-form solutions do not exist), the uniroot function in R is
used to obtain the root of the analytic derivative of the production
function relative to the biomass, over the interval 0.1K to K.</p>

<h3>Calculation of uncertainty for estimates of MSY and BMSY</h3>
<p>To estimate uncertainty, a multivariate normal sampling distribution
was is from the parameter estimates and their associated
variance-covariance matrix, calculated in R from the Hessian matrix
produced by TMB in the model-fitting process. For each biomass dynamics
model, a specified number of estimates of <span class="math inline">\(MSY\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B_{MSY}\)</span> can be generated using the model
parameter values generated from resampling the multivariate normal
distribution. The 95 % confidence limits for <span class="math inline">\(MSY\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B_{MSY}\)</span> are taken as the 2.5th and 97.5th
percentiles of the generated values.</p>
